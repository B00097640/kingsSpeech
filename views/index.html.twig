        Kings Speech is a play about King George VI who found it really hard to manage with his stammer.<br>
        He had a wife Queen Elizabeth who insisted him to meet with Lionel Logue who was originally from australia.<br>
        Also known as bertie by King George's family. Lionel Logue's role is to help King George VI with his stammer problems.<br>
        The relationship between the two aren't so great but when things get tough the both are there for one another.<br>
